# STANDUP 01 - 2/10/2023 TEAM Robomaster


General Update and Intro
========================
Teams assembled and introduced, selected Project Leaders: Amanda Kwong and Austin Guiney
Talked to TA
Voted to use Jira to keep track of Working Packages/Tasks
Created Github repo: https://github.com/amandakwong898/robomaster/


Draft of Requirements
=====================
MAIN: We need to investigate different types of reinforcement learning algorithms by 
training our model (Robomaster S1) to complete a certain task, and exploring the impact of 
hyperparameters on training outcomes. We will create interactive dashboards that display 
key metrics and insights from our model.
The software needs to support
* Self driving program around an obstacle course using computer vision
* Use machine learning to determine the best path (try out different algorithms)
* Data visualization (scatter plot for each algorithm)

We will create separate branches for each team member and submit pull requests 
to the main branch.

For technologies, we propose
* Python, Tensorflow, Github
* html5 ,css3 , Bootstrap, Typescript, Vue3.js, Firebase


Current Questions / Problems / Something you need
=================================================
* We need to get Robomasters for team members for prototyping
* We need to figure out how to gain root access to Robomaster to use SDK external to app


List of Working Packages with responsible Student and Completion Dates
======================================================================
* Investigate the Robomaster "hack." Are there limitations with the official API? [Amanda Kwong] by 2/13
* Investigate the official API for the Robomaster [Austin Guiney] by 2/17
* Pick up Robomasters and assemble them [Austin Guiney, Chirag Nagendra, Sanjana Nakhwa] by 2/15
* Email Professor Haehn to sign out Robomaster by 2/10 EOD
