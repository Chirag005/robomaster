# STANDUP 01 - 2/10/2023 TEAM Robomaster


General Update and Intro
========================
Teams assembled and introduced, selected Project Leaders: Amanda Kwong and Austin Guiney
Talked to TA
Voted to use Jira to keep track of Working Packages/Tasks
Created Github repo: https://github.com/amandakwong898/robomaster/
We need to get and assemble Robomasters for team members for prototyping (ip)


Draft of Requirements
=====================
MAIN: We need to investigate different types of reinforcement learning algorithms by 
training our model (Robomaster S1) to complete a certain task, and exploring the impact of 
hyperparameters on training outcomes. We will create interactive dashboards that display 
key metrics and insights from our model.
The software needs to support
* **Self driving program around an obstacle course using computer vision.**
* Use machine learning to determine the best path around the obstacle course.
* Compare different path-finding algorithms. 
* Data visualization (scatter plot) for each algorithm.

We will create separate branches for each team member and submit pull requests 
to the main branch.

For technologies, we propose
* Python, Tensorflow, Github
* HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Typescript, Vue3.js, Firebase


Current Questions / Problems / Something you need
=================================================
* We need to figure out how to gain root access to Robomaster to use SDK external to app.
* We need to figure out if the official API for the Robomaster is sufficient for our project.
* We need to research how to acquire preprocessed data to train our RoboMaster S1
  * record the states, actions, and rewards of the system as the robot moves through its environment
